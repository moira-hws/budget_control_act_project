# Defense spending austerity, localized recessions, and the geography of political discontent

Research questions:  (1)  Did the contraction in defense spending following the 2011 BCA precipitate local recessions in manufacturing and other defense-related sectors?  (2) If the answer is yes, were these localized recessions spatially coincident with the communities that moved to the right in the 2016 presidential election?

Data summary:
DOD contracts 2000-2020 (NAICS code and contract value; zip code scale)
Economic census data (employment and firm counts by relevant NAICS codes; county scale)
* Balance of trade statistics (export values or location quotients for relevant NAICS codes; trade district scale)
* Political shifts (see what levels are available; probably county)

Methods:
Map localized manufacturing recessions and losses in DOD contracts, identify any spatially coincident areas

Alt methods:
Distributed lag models relating changes in DOD investments to changes in local NAICS code economic indicators
If needed, identify areas of recession (assign 1 or 0) in the industries of note and use a lagged logistic regression to see whether changes in DOD spending at various preceding years predicts recessions
Causal methods (e.g., instrumental variable, DID, DAGs, or regression discontinuity) to evaluate the relationship between localized recessions following the BCA and political shifts in 2016
